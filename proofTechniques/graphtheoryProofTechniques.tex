\section{General Problem Solving, Testprep}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Look at small examples 
    \item what similar problems theorems do I know what is different
    \item take a step back and dont get fixiated on the first idea and try 
        a completly different way of looking at the problem
    \item start with the most difficult problems
    \item work on a problem as long as I can make progress, if I do not know
        how to continue switch to another problem
    \item see solution in big picture, \enquote{does this make sense?}
    \item relax while taking test, focus on breathing 
    \item see test as sports event to show of all the hard work in the past
\end{enumerate}


\section{Basics}
\paragraph{Minimality/Maximality of Object}
Assume that you have a shortest or longest walk,path and show that you can 
get a contradiction by a constructing a shorter / longer path.

\paragraph{Assume the opposite and find contradiction}
Lets assume for the sake of contradiction...

\paragraph{Induction}

\paragraph{Induction with different cases after removing a vertex}
If removign a leaf from a tree there can be multiple cases to be 
considered depending on for example the new maximum degree

\paragraph{Some parameter has specific value}
try to show lower bound and upper bound by general example for all
$ n \in \mathbb{N} $
